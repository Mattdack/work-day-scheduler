## Description 

This [Work Day Scheduler](mattdack.github.io/work-day-scheduler) provides an interface for users to enter and save events or tasks during work-day hours, save them, and reload the page to view them again. On page load the site updates the date. The background for each input section is updated with a background color to indicate whether the time slot is in the past, present, and future. The site utilizes moment.js, event listening, and local storage to achieve this functionality. The site is styled by bootstrap with additional custom styling.
